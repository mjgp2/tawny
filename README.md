### Development Instructions

#### To set up a local development environment

* Clone this repository to you development directory
* `cd` to the new directory
* Run `npm install` to run install dependencies (you may have to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) if you don't already have it)

#### Working with the build script

The source files for the project reside in the `src` directory. The `gulp` build script `gulpfile.js` is set up to automate a number steps required to deploy the bookmarklet into its production form. The command `gulp` runs the `default` task in the build script, which is set up to:

* Clear the `dist` directory removing previous builds
* Copy the markup directly into `dist`
* Compile any less stylesheets in `src/styles` into CSS and copy into `dist`
* Minify any JavaScript in `src/scripts` and copy into `dist`
* Minify the bookmarklet source JavaScript from `src/bookmarklet` and copy the minified code into `dist`
* Inject the minified bookmarklet into the page for use (the script replaces the placeholder text `###BOOKMARKLET###` in `dist/index.html`)

#### To deploy the `dist` directory to GitHub Pages

* Commit and push the `dist` directory in the state you want to deploy
* Run ```git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages``` to push `dist` to the root of the `gh-pages` branch

The site at [https://github.com/odub/tawny](https://github.com/odub/tawny) should now be the same as the last committed version of the `dist` directory.
